\method{subset}{ped}(x, subset, ..., missingParents = c("error", "exclude", "include"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ped} object, or a list of such.}

\item{father, mother}{Single ID labels. At least one of these must be an
existing member of \code{x}. The other may be (i) another existing member, (ii)
a new founder to be created, or (iii) missing (i.e., NULL), in which case
the other parent is created and given a suitable name.}

\item{nch}{A positive integer indicating the number of children to be
created. Default: 1.}

\item{sex}{Gender codes of the created children (recycled if needed).}

\item{ids}{A vector of ID labels. In \code{addChildren()} these are the children
to be created. If NULL (default) given, automatic labels are generated.}

\item{verbose}{A logical: Verbose output or not.}

\item{parents}{A vector of 1 or 2 ID labels, of which at least one must be an
existing member of \code{x}.}

\item{id}{The ID label of a pedigree member.}

\item{remove}{Either "ancestors" or "descendants" (default), dictating the
method of removing pedigree members. Abbreviations are allowed.}

\item{returnLabs}{A logical, by default FALSE. If TRUE, \code{removeIndividuals()}
returns only the labels of all members to be removed, instead of actually
removing them.}

\item{uninformative}{A vector naming individuals considered "uninformative",
or a function (typically a helper function like \code{\link[=untypedMembers]{untypedMembers()}}).
Uninformative leaves are removed iteratively until no more can be found.}

\item{subset}{A character vector (or coercible to such): A subset of the ID
labels of \code{x}.}

\item{...}{Not used.}

\item{missingParents}{A word indicating how to deal with single parents in
the subset. Either "error" (default), "exclude" (remove the parent-child
connection) or "include" (expand \code{subset} to include the missing parents).}
}
\value{

\description{
Functions for adding or removing individuals in a 'ped' object.
}
\details{
In \code{addChildren()} and \code{addParents()}, labels of added individuals are
generated automatically if they are not specified by the user. The automatic
labelling uses the smallest integers not already in use.

\code{addChild()}, \code{addSon()} and \code{addDaughter()} are convenient wrappers for the
most common use of \code{addChildren()}, namely adding a single child to a
pedigree. Note that the parents can be given in any order. If only one parent
is supplied, the other is created as a new individual.

\code{removeIndividuals()} removes the individuals indicated with \code{ids} along with
all of their ancestors OR descendants, depending on the \code{remove} argument.
Leftover spouses disconnected from the remaining pedigree are also removed.

The \code{branch()} function extracts the sub-pedigree formed by \code{id} and all
his/her descendants, and all necessary spouses. Note that some structure may
be lost in this process; for instance, compare \code{x = halfSibTriangle(3)} with
\code{branch(x, 1)}.

The \code{trim()} function iteratively removes uninformative leaves (i.e., members
without children) from the pedigree. Note that the definition of
"uninformative" is entirely user-defined. For example, \code{trim(x, untypedMembers)}, will remove untyped individuals from the bottom until the
process stops.

Finally, \code{subset()} can be used to extract any sub-pedigree, returning a list
of pedigrees if the result is disconnected. By default, an error is raised if
some individuals would be left with exactly one parent. Alternatively,
\code{missingParents = "exclude"} removes the parent–child connection in such
cases, while \code{missingParents = "include"} adds the missing parent to the
subset.

\examples{

x = nuclearPed(1) |>
  addSon(3) |>
  addParents(4, father = 6, mother = 7) |>
  addChildren(father = 6, mother = 7, nch = 3, sex = c(2,1,2))

# Remove 6 and 7 and their descendants
y1 = removeIndividuals(x, 6:7)

# Remove 8-10 and their parents
y2 = removeIndividuals(x, 8:10, remove = "ancestors")

# Adding a child across components
z = singletons(1:2, sex = 1:2) |> addDaughter(1:2)

# Extract a branch
w = cousinPed(1, child = TRUE)
w4 = branch(w, 4)
plot(list(w, w4))

# General subsetting depends on `missingParent`:
subset(w, c(3,7), missingParents = "exclude")
subset(w, c(3,7), missingParents = "include")
