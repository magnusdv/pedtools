Description: A comprehensive collection of tools for creating,
    manipulating and visualising pedigrees and genetic marker data.
    Pedigrees can be read from text files or created on the fly with
    built-in functions. A range of utilities enable modifications like
    adding or removing individuals, breaking loops, and merging pedigrees.
    An online tool for creating pedigrees interactively, based on
    'pedtools', is available at <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped>.
    'pedtools' is the hub of the 'pedsuite', a collection of packages for
    pedigree analysis. A detailed presentation of the 'pedsuite' is given
    in the book 'Pedigree Analysis in R' (Vigeland, 2021,
    ISBN:9780128244302).
