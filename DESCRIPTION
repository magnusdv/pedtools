Description: A comprehensive collection of tools for creating, manipulating and 
    visualising pedigrees and genetic marker data. Pedigrees can be read from text 
    files or created on the fly with built-in functions. A range of utilities 
    enable modifications like adding or removing individuals, breaking loops, and 
    merging pedigrees. Pedigree plots are produced by wrapping the plotting 
    functionality of the 'kinship2' package. A Shiny app for creating pedigrees, 
    based on 'pedtools', is available at <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped>. 
    'pedtools' is the hub of the 'ped suite', a collection of packages for 
    pedigree analysis. A detailed presentation of the 'ped suite' is given in
    the book 'Pedigree Analysis in R' (Vigeland, 2021, ISBN:9780128244302).
