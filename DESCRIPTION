Description: A lightweight, but comprehensive collection of tools for creating, 
    manipulating and visualising pedigrees and genetic marker data. Pedigrees 
    can be read from text files or created on the fly with built-in functions. 
    A range of utilities enable modifications like adding or removing individuals,
    breaking loops, and merging pedigrees. Pedigree plots are produced by wrapping
    the plotting functionality of the 'kinship2' package.
